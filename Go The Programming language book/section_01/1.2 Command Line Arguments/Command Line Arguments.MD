### Command Line Arguments

When you run a program, you can pass arguments to it.
In Go we can pass arguments too. 
All arguments saved in a `os.Args` slice. firest `os.Args[0]` of it is the name of the program.
We can get length of a slice with `len(sliceName)`.

With `var` we can declare a variable. with `var s string` we declare a variable `s` of type `string`.
